This blog shall be a blog about recent projects and thoughts and whatever cool stuff I end up doing.\n\nFirst, I need to learn and understand how hosting a blog works. I use the Quarto blog. Quarto uses files such as Jupyter Notebooks to create a Webpage(who doesn't love Jupyter notebooks). The cool thing about having Jupyter Notebooks is that we can put code executables on the blog such as this:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint('Hello World!')\n# What an icon first line for this blog\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHello World!\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen we have our blog post finished we can use commands such as: `quarto render` and then we add and commit our changes, and finally push to the repository. If we are hosting on a service such as Github Pages.\n\nWe can also display images. \n\n![Pikachu](pikachu.png)\n\n",
