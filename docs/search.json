This blog shall be a blog about recent projects and thoughts and whatever cool stuff I end up doing.\nFirst, I need to learn and understand how hosting a blog works. I use the Quarto blog. Quarto uses files such as Jupyter Notebooks to create a Webpage(who doesnâ€™t love Jupyter notebooks). The cool thing about having Jupyter Notebooks is that we can put code executables on the blog such as this:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n# What an icon first line for this blog\n\nHello World!\n\n\nWhen we have our blog post finished we can use commands such as: quarto render and then we add and commit our changes, and finally push to the repository. If we are hosting on a service such as Github Pages.\nWe can also display images.\n\n\n\nPikachu"
