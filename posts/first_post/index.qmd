This is my first post ever created. Welcome. This blog shall be a blog about recent projects and thoughts and whatever cool stuff I end up doing.

First, I need to learn and understand how hosting a blog works. I use the Quarto blog. Quarto uses files such as Jupyter Notebooks to create a Webpage(who doesn't love Jupyter notebooks). The cool thing about having Jupyter Notebooks is that we can put code executables on the blog such as this:

```{python}
print('Hello World!')
# What an icon first line for this blog
```

When we have our blog post finished we can use commands such as: `quarto render` and then we add and commit our changes, and finally push to the repository. If we are hosting on a service such as Github Pages.

We can also display images. Such as this one below.
